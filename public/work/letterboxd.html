                    <h1>Exploring the film social network</h1>
                    <p>In 2019, I found myself increasingly drawn towards film, and was lucky enough to be surrounded by people who I could share this love with. One of my new favorite sites is definitely Letterboxd, a film-focused social networking service. First introduced to it from film Twitter circles by seeing joke reviews highlighted on Oscar-nominated masterpieces, the sense of community it offered finally drew me onto the platform knowing it wouldn’t solely be traditional film buffs.</p>
                    
                    <p>Letterboxd has been an amazing tool that has moved me to be more introspective about the film I consume, but it took a while for me to fully get into it, and the more that I use it — the more I’ve been thinking about ways to improve some of its features.</p>
                        
                    <p>The following is a survey of some of the main frustrations on the web version of Letterboxd that I’ve collected from regular engagement with film communities, and my proposed redesigns and feature introductions.</p>

                    <h1>Improving the Movie Logging Flow</h1>
                    
                    <p>As Letterboxd’s creators get right: the first thing we want to do after we see a film is talk about it. On the film social network, why is it difficult and unintuitive to access the film logging feature when many of its social features and engagement notifications rely on it?</p><br>

                    <h3>Issues&mdash;Movie Logging</h3>
                    
                    <p>The next Philippine elections are happening in 2022. The team behind Letterboxd is thinking of how to further transform the digital space for education, awareness, and discussion as we did with Letterboxd&mdash;with these 2022 elections, we have a lot to tackle. Thankfully, Letterboxd's pilot taught us about establishing user loyalty&mdash;and how things will never end up as you expect.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Design to satisfy user desires: we furthered Letterboxd's social presence as users moved to use our tools to carry conversations over.</li>

                        <li>Neutrality is not an option: designing to reach those who could change their viewpoints and spread the word to support our candidates was priority&mdash;tech is never neutral.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>There's value in engaging with the principles that voters believe in, and using those as grounds to understand, listen, and respond effectively. <em>Fighting categorization and labeling</em> through engagement was key, and we're looking forward to more spaces that encourage discussions like this.</p>
