                    <p><strong>MY ROLE</strong>&mdash;For this project, I acted as a lead researcher, project manager, and engineer developing the flow of Iboto.ph and our presence on different platforms. By the end, Iboto.ph had garnered millions of hits on our website, reached over 600,000 engagements on Facebook, and received the official attention from over 6 senatorial canddiates.</p>

                    <h1>Transforming the digital space in political contexts</h1>
                    
                    <p>Through Iboto.ph, we were astounded not only by the traction and numbers we hit, but by the engagement of the platform. <u>The internet is a tool not maximally used by candidates</u>: this project we came up with in only three weeks, sometimes doing the barebones work of comprehensively talking about a candidate's platforms, set us up to realize how much more work could be done in the space.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Questions for engagement</h3>
                    <p>Our page and contact email frequently received questions about how to further a specific cause, or support the work of candidates. Other inquiries that we received were on the actions and next steps of candidates that we had featured, and also people sharing information on candidates that align with their views that weren't necessarily up on the site.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility and usage</h3>
                    <p>The highly iterative research and design process was very constricting at times. Because we were so engrossed in ensuring everything was credited, sources were verified, and materials were fact-checked, it was harder to do more drastic changes to the structure of the pages. Large recommendations were to make materials accessible in different Filipino languages&mdash;of which there are over 150 spoken languages and 6 were frequently requested. We were not able to recruit translators and were only able to offer the website in English (which is an official language of the Philippines), and had to resort to visual cues and our external social platforms to continue engagement for users more comfortable in their languages. For further iterations of Iboto.ph, a focus on getting translators will be established; as well as being less text-dependent and having different ways for users to navigate similar candidates beyond text information.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Adapting to use cases</h3>
                    <p>We had received a lot of feedback on new ways users were engaging with our platform and did our best to respond (e.g. adding more information to social previews after many users were drawn to the site because of this, or creating text-based information sheets after seeing numbers on free data users on our social pages). For more work on Iboto.ph, we want to explore more methods and flows of how users navigate our tool, and help better cater the experience for different needs&mdash;and nudge existing users towards impactful journeys.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Combatting disinformation</h3>
                    <p>With how the product and its platforms were established and structured, we were able to move forward and execute mini-campaigns and fact-checks on disinformation and illegal campaigning done in the election season. This was from fixing vote counts, informing the public about fallacious statements made by officials, and more. Although lots of transformation happened in the social media space, we also re-emphasized the value of dedicated sites, especially for political use that establish stronger credibility and connections.</p>

                        <h3>Learnings</h3>
                       The next Philippine elections are happening in 2022. The team behind Iboto.ph is thinking of how to further transform the digital space for education, awareness, and discussion as we did with Iboto.ph&mdash;with these 2022 elections, we have a lot to tackle. Thankfully, Iboto.ph's pilot taught us about establishing user loyalty&mdash;and how things will never end up as you expect.<br>There's value in engaging with the principles that voters believe in, and using those as grounds to understand, listen, and respond effectively. <em>Fighting categorization and labeling</em> through engagement was key, and we're looking forward to more spaces that encourage discussions like this.
