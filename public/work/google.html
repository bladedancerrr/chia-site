                        <p class="summary" style="color:#090b33;">Twitter wants to be the place where people find out what's happening about the world, now. However, with the growth in Twitter's users and new algorithms that tend to result in more "viral" content, it's easier for people to feel lost in the conversation. Our objective was to make <strong>notifications and engagements more intuitive at scale</strong>, to convert and measure more follower relationships and sustained interaction between users.</p>


                        <div class="summary-details">

                    <h2>Brief</h2>
                    <p>Prompted to <em>strengthen community</em> through mentorship programming, I was tasked to design an experience that allows mentors and mentees to discover one another.</p>
                    
                    <p>Even before entering Yale, students are given a wealth of resources: their residential college (future housing), upper-year mentors, and resident counselors that all form a distinctive part of their first-year experience: academically, culturally, and socially - especially in the overwhelming fall.</p>

                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Navigating a wealth of resources can easily be overwhelming to navigate for first-years – and difficult to coordinate for upper-years: <mark>how can students maximize on these engagements and know when to access which resource?</mark><br>Building on existing infrastructure, I wanted to create an experience serving both mentors and mentees– bringing new opportunities for Yalies to connect that reflect the diversity of the student body.</p>


                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <p>I talked to current first-years and Yale campus life leads to see what mentorship-based  transitional resources exist, and what might be lacking from each.</p>

  <tr>
    <th>Freshman Counselors (FroCo)</th>
    <th>Peer Liaison Program</th>
    <th>Dean/Head of College</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lives with first-years, mentors are seniors -- rigorous program; work collectively, each 9-10 students per college 100-150</td>
    <td>Upper-level students (sophomores - seniors); regulated per cultural center, and 0-2 per residential college</td>
    <td>Direct connection to administrative and residential college support</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Chosen for diverse range of experiences, particularly overcoming academic/personal struggles</td>
    <td>Chosen for to existing cultural centers, international student community, Chaplain’s Office, or LGBTQ community</td>
    <td>Acts as academic and personal adviser; lives in residential college (where most  first-years do not live yet)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Runs structured programs at the start of the year, later on ad hoc work and focused on "duty hours" at nights</td>

                    <h2>Decision: Focusing on affiliated mentorship</h2>
                    <p>
From this, I decided on an experience that put these programs together on the onboarding end made it easier for peer liaisons--thanks to their less rigid structure and connection with cultural centers.</p>

                    <p>After deciding to target the peer liaison program, I continued short talks with first and second-years as well as current and alumni PLs and a now-alumni freshman counselor to synthesize their expectations and perceptions about current programs.</p>
                    
                    

                    <h3>Pain Points</h3>

                    <span class="image-container" style="padding:1em; float: right;">

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Managing student demand</strong><br>
                        With increasing class sizes, it's harder for mentors to keep up with demand: often shuffling over fifteen potential mentees. The lack of transparency over the mentor onboarding process means that mentor application's dont match demand.</li>

                        <li><strong>Lack of coordination between mentorship programs and centers.</strong><br>
                            
                        Mentors are sometimes confused about their scope of work, and mentees develop relationships with less depth with the lack of clarity in action.
                        <em>This actually harms the diversity on-campus since programs are disjoint!</em>
                        
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Communication breakdowns.</strong><br>
                        Mentee needs are unpredictable and mentors need to keep up heavy workloads while communicating check-ins and reminders to mentees. Without existing infrastructure, how can we build a grounds for sharing info to mentees? </li>

                    </ol>

                    <p>Interestingly, many users sharing their frustrations gave <strong>comparisons</strong>&mdash;they weren't looking for new groundbreaking features or algorithmic changes, they wanted QoL functionalities present in other apps. These smaller gestures and usability pieces stuck out to us as our focus.</p>

                    </span>

                    <p>From this series of observations and with our personas in mind, we defined goals based on Twitter's recent prodduct releases and opportunity areas in our problem scope:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Use tweet engagements as a space to drive more connections through an <em>entrypoint for follow-follower relationships, and continued conversations through quote tweets.</em></li>
                        <li>Increase user engagement with people outside of their mutual space (people who follow them, others) <mark>increasing follow-up interactions</mark>; and</li>
                        <li>Increase user follow-follower relationship entrypoints through the engagement space</li>

                    </ol>


                    <p>We want Cane to not feel overwhelmed when he goes viral, or be able to join in the conversation even after a few hours. Mary wants to sort through replies faster because they have little time, and feel like their inputs are being seen when responding to larger figureheads&mdash;they may also benefit from more followers and interaction.</p>

                    <center>
                        <div class="p-emphasis"> Our goal is to reframe Twitter's engagements as a space to form connections&mdash;at any size, to convert likes, retweets, and replies, into places for follow relationships and continued conversation </div>
                    </center>

                    <p><strong>Repurposing existing components</strong> was also a key design decision. There are QoL fixes and shouldn't take too much sprints to put out; we wanted something measurable that wouldn't take too much engineering time away from larger features: so to keep the design true and build on many underexplored portions of Twitter's functionality, everything is reused.</p>




                    <h2 id="part-design">Design</h2>
                    <h1>Bridging new interactions through better journeys</h1>


                    <p>Better engagements introduces an array of quality of life fixes in the <mark>tweet and timeline engagements area</mark>, here's a brief overview of the spaces that we're touching:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Search Engagements</strong>: This allows users to search under the “liked by” and “retweeted by” menu’s to see which accounts engaged with that tweet</li>

                        <li><strong>Quote Tweet Presence</strong>: Allows users to see the who quoted tweets and what they said. Enables continued conversation whether it be about comedy or politics</li>

                        <li><strong>Categorized engagements</strong>: Along with searching through the accounts who've liked or shared a tweet, we're ordering them in collapsible categories based on your follow relationship – enabling you to discover new people or see your interactions with your mutuals</li>

                    </ul>


                   

                    </ul>

                    <p>Better Engagements is also a take on control over communities. The tweets we engage with are very telling&mdash;it's a common joke for a reason that "to know someone truly you should look through their Twitter llikes." </p>
