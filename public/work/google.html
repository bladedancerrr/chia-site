However, with the growth in Twitter's users and new algorithms that tend to result in more "viral" content, it's easier for people to feel lost in the conversation. Our objective was to make <strong>notifications and engagements more intuitive at scale</strong>, to convert and measure more follower relationships and sustained interaction between users.</p>

                    <h2>Brief</h2>
                    <p>Prompted to <em>strengthen community</em> through mentorship programming, I was tasked to design an experience that allows mentors and mentees to discover one another.</p>
                    
                    <p>Even before entering Yale, students are given a wealth of resources: their residential college (future housing), upper-year mentors, and resident counselors that all form a distinctive part of their first-year experience: academically, culturally, and socially - especially in the overwhelming fall.</p>

                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Navigating a wealth of resources can easily be overwhelming to navigate for first-years – and difficult to coordinate for upper-years: <mark>how can students maximize on these engagements and know when to access which resource?</mark><br>Building on existing infrastructure, I wanted to create an experience serving both mentors and mentees– bringing new opportunities for Yalies to connect that reflect the diversity of the student body.</p>


                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <p>I talked to current first-years and Yale campus life leads to see what mentorship-based  transitional resources exist, and what might be lacking from each.</p>

                    <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Freshman Counselors (FroCo)</th>
    <th>Peer Liaison Program</th>
    <th>Dean/Head of College</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lives with first-years, mentors are seniors -- rigorous program; work collectively, each 9-10 students per college 100-150</td>
    <td>Upper-level students (sophomores - seniors); regulated per cultural center, and 0-2 per residential college</td>
    <td>Direct connection to administrative and residential college support</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Chosen for diverse range of experiences, particularly overcoming academic/personal struggles</td>
    <td>Chosen for to existing cultural centers, international student community, Chaplain’s Office, or LGBTQ community</td>
    <td>Acts as academic and personal adviser; lives in residential college (where most  first-years do not live yet)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Runs structured programs at the start of the year, later on ad hoc work and focused on "duty hours" at nights</td>
    <td>Chosen for diversity in major, background, experience</td>

                    <h2>Decision: Focusing on affiliated mentorship</h2>
                    
                    <blockquote class="testimonial">
                        "I want the opportunity to explore all my identities, but sometimes [the PL program] felt disjoint and overwhelming."
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
From this, I decided on an experience that put these programs together on the onboarding end made it easier for peer liaisons&mdash;thanks to their less rigid structure and connection with cultural centers.</p>

                    <p>After deciding to target the peer liaison program, I continued short talks with first and second-years as well as current and alumni PLs and a now-alumni freshman counselor to synthesize their expectations and perceptions about current programs.</p>
                    
                    

                    <h3>Pain Points</h3>

                    <span class="image-container" style="padding:1em; float: right;">
                        <center> <img style="max-width:400px" src="../assets/portfolio/twitter/journey-1.png">
                            <sub>The current user journey for the problems described</sub></center>
                    </span>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Managing student demand</strong><br>
                        With increasing class sizes, it's harder for mentors to keep up with demand: <mark>handling 10+ mentees</mark>. The lack of clarity in the mentor onboarding process is also frustrating and turns away potential applicants.</li>

                        <li><strong>Lack of coordination between mentorship programs and centers.</strong><br>
                            
                        Mentors are sometimes confused about their scope of work, and mentees develop relationships with less depth with the lack of clarity in action.
                        <em>This actually harms the diversity on-campus since programs are disjoint&mdash;they don't reflect the students wholly!</em>
                        
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Communication breakdowns.</strong><br>
                        Mentee needs are unpredictable and mentors need to keep up heavy workloads while communicating check-ins and reminders to mentees. Without existing infrastructure, how can we build a grounds for sharing info to mentees? </li>

                    </ol>

                    <p>Interestingly, many users sharing their frustrations gave <strong>comparisons</strong>&mdash;they weren't looking for new groundbreaking features or algorithmic changes, they wanted QoL functionalities present in other apps. These smaller gestures and usability pieces stuck out to us as our focus.</p>

                        <p>Checks on Twitter multiple times a day (more when procrastinating) as a nineteen-year-old university student up-to-date on pop culture. Twitter is not just for news, more like tidbits, first joke source. and group DMs. Interacts mostly with friends with a &lt;700 followers, most are mutuals. Follows celebrities, pop culture, andd comedy accounts on Twitter. Engages liberally through likes and retweets and isn't afraid to tweet their mind or have conversations run long in threads.</p>

                    <h2>PROCESS</h2>
                    <p>For the exercise, I decided to rehaul the mentorship experience for the web. Students will be accessing these mentorship portals before arriving at school: I conducted look-and-learn sessions to see how students discovered info about their liaisons and went in contact with them. With the amount of thought/information on the project, the web was most intuitive for these longer onboarding experiences when settling key school flows.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        From here on, I began building mockups and going through cycles of product solutions to validate my assumptions.
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Project Area Identification</h3>
                    <p>From the initial research, I identified three distinct areas of the mentor-mentee relationships:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mentor Onboarding</strong>
                        <br>    
                        <em>How can experienced Yale students best be informed and be ready to with the resources to guide first-years?</em><br>
                        The clarification of the liaison application process, as well as consolidation of training deadlines and information.
                        </li>
                        
                        
                        <li><strong>Discovery & Connection</strong><br><em>How can community-affiliated liaisons best be matched with students to build fruitful relationships?</em></li>
                        
                        
                        <li><strong>Communication</strong><br>
                            
                          <em>How can we prevent communication breakdowns and make it easier for mentors and mentees to reach each other throughout the academic year?</em>
</li>
                        
                        
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Design Audit & Component Library</h3>
                    <p>Before working on mockups, I took to Yale's existing application forms and tools for the layout and for later high-fidelity conversions. Luckily, a semester working as a designer-developer at the Yale University Art Gallery made me familiar with university style guides and practices.</p>
                    <p>Because I'm taking on the task of creating cohesion for the liaison program, I wanted to continue building off the university's present systems. I reused components and titling through a small system on Figma.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <h2>Project Area: Onboarding</h2>
                    <h1>Clarifying the mentor onboarding process</h1>
                    <p>Since these mentorship programs at Yale are given significant institutional backing, application processes are intensive and rigorous. I wanted to keep the nature and support of the program, streamlining it so users could explore things more.</p>
                    
                    <p>I tested andd iterated drafts for the new web views, all in Yale's style.</p>

                    <h2>HIGHLIGHTING THE PEER LIAISON PROGRAM</h2>
                    <p>I redesigned the portal for mentorship at Yale to highlight the cultural centers and diversity offered on-campus. Previously, everything was stuck in one page with little info: centers linked to individual websites, some outdated and with inconsistent info. Information sessions and PL-wide events can also be disseminated in the new landing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Repurposing existing components</strong> was also a key design decision. There are QoL fixes and shouldn't take too much sprints to put out; we wanted something measurable that wouldn't take too much engineering time away from larger features: so to keep the design true and build on many underexplored portions of Twitter's functionality, everything is reused.</p>

                        <li><strong>Categorized engagements</strong>: Along with searching through the accounts who've liked or shared a tweet, we're ordering them in collapsible categories based on your follow relationship – enabling you to discover new people or see your interactions with your mutuals</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>Better Engagements is also a take on control over communities. The tweets we engage with are very telling&mdash;it's a common joke for a reason that "to know someone truly you should look through their Twitter llikes." </p>
