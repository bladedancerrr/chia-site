                    <h1>The music platform for diehards</h1>
                    <p>The beauty of Last.fm is that it puts discovery, community, and data together. Around for decades but more relevant than ever in a disjointed musicspace, I needed to visit it.<br>Last year, Spotify Wrapped told me I totaled 140,000 minutes of listening (excluding my YT + local collection). As a music fan, I fell in love with the product: it understands my activity over time, connects me with over buffs, and helps me find new new tracks.</p>

                    <p>Last.fm brands itself as your <mark>"musical calling card".</mark> However, the mobile application doesn't reflect this yet. I set out to design a mobile experience for Last.fm: <em>the go-to place for music from everywhere should be accessible anywhere.</em></p>



                    <span class="image-container">

                        <em>Present Last.fm mobile app</em>
                    </span>

                    <p><strong>At present</strong>, the Last.fm mobile app shows you your aggregated music ("scrobble") history and some stats. Let's see what's missing. </p>

            <h3>User Comments on Last.fm</h3>
            
            <div class="feature-testimonials">
                <div class="testimonial">
                Legit go out of my way to make sure everything I listen to is scrobbled. Having 90% of my music listening history going all the way back to 2006 is rad.
                </div>       
                <div class="testimonial">
                I still use it for <strong>tracking what I listen to</strong>, but I haven't used it for listening to music in ages.
                </div>     
                <div class="testimonial">
                For me Last.Fm serves a different purpose of tracking how much music I've listened to. Where something like RYM is more of creating a catalogue of what I though about albums as well as discovering.
                </div>  
                <div class="testimonial">
                I just use Last.Fm just to track how many times I've listened to something, <strong>I really love stats</strong> (maybe because i'm a sports fan) but ill listen to Spotify and use Last.FM to track what i hear on there.
                </div> 
                <div class="testimonial">
                 I actually recently got Last.fm because I really like seeing the statistics of what I listen to. Also, <strong>if anybody asks me what music I like, I can just show them my Last.fm profile.</strong> I do enjoy showing my tastes off to other people. I don’t really know of anything else that can track my listening habits from all platforms better than this.
                </div>
                <div class="testimonial">
                 Last.fm has always been about the stats for me and it still provides that. Probably way, way more efficiently than the old site did, actually, since it is now incredibly easy to look at, for any time interval you want, most-played artists or songs or albums, or songs by artist/by album, or jump to a certain date, or to a certain month, or compare play counts for months, or track which years/months you most listened to a certain artist... etc etc.

            </div>
                    
                    <p>With these comments, I thought exploring a design that focused on bettering stat and history features&mdash;a key core part of Last.fm's enjoyability today.</p>

                    <p>I talked to existing Last.fm users and explored Last.fm alternatives to explore issues with the current mobile experience. What I found <mark>aligned with my personal experiences: the Last.fm app is underwhelming,</mark> it displays the raw data, but doesn't <em>synthesize it.</em></p>

                    <p>What does Last.fm serve when it tracks music you're playing on your phone, without letting you dive into that history? Tracking and listening history would become a priority.<br> As we go mobile: users should be able to breakdown their music history and pull it up as needed.</p>

                    <h3>New Architecture & Map</h3>

                    <p>For this iteration of the redesign, I prioritized building an onboarding flow, showcasing listening history and statistics, reworking the way music information is presented, and introducing the social aspects of the site on mobile through profiles. </p>

                    <h1>A redesigned musicscape</h1>

                    <p>To begin, I built lo-fidelity mocks for the home, top listening stats and music (artist, album, track) screens. The following are mid-fidelity looks into my proposed redesigns.</p>
                    
                    <p>Last.fm is an incredible product that has the potential to expand its existing demographic and userbase (largely diehard music fans, extensive listeners) into the masses. By pushing on screens and nudging the user towards discovery, I wanted to be intentional about including features that could build on this service.</p>

                    <h1></h1>

                    <p>As a product, Last.fm has a dwindling userbase and desperately needs to be the best at its many developed features over the years. To me and in this redesign, that was how in an age of mobile streaming over dozens of services: it <mark>connected and made sense of everything</mark>, empowering me as a listener by letting me know the data behind my behavior.</p>

                    <p>Instead of falling into a trap of underused prompts or spaces, I'm interested in seeing how the dead simple edge as a <em>musical calling card</em> can lead to everything else: discovery, engagement, and more streams. I'm certain there's power in these building blocks even if the mobile redesign doesn't have the entire web featureset: there's already so much we can get from these numbers and materials. They're simply universal to every listener.</p>


                    <ul class="feature-large">
                        <li><strong>Going social ❔ </strong><br>
                            This design only featured user profiles as a beginning engagement space. If put into action, it would be interesting to observe data on how users engage with one another&mdash;especially while only currently prompted by music pages.</li>

                        <li><strong>Listening activity ❔ </strong><br>With the redesign, it would be interesting to capture how much more active listeners are. Are they only checking on Last.fm to see their latest activity? Do their behaviors change now that there's more numbers and customization that reflect their listens?</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>Again, all of this is still a work-in-progress. Let me know what you think, or better yet&mdash;let me know how you listen. </p>
