                        <p class="summary">Last.fm is <em>the</em> music search & discovery network. In a time of streaming sites galore, Last.fm remains the go-to space for strong listeners to track history, fan over songs, and find people just like them. As we move more onto mobile listening, I thought of revamping the aged Last.fm application to give weight to the music we love.

                    <h1>Learning and spreading what you love</h1>
                    <p>The beauty of Last.fm is that it puts discovery together with community, while providing comprehensive listening statistics from every platform I listen to. It's essentially a music lover's dream: data-driven and social&mdash;and it seems the music community agrees</p>
                    
                    <p>Last.fm brands itself as your "musical calling card." However, the mobile application doesn't reflect this yet. </p>

                        <em>Present Last.fm mobile app</em>
                    </span>
                    
                    <p>At present, the Last.fm mobile app shows you your music history, and has tabs dedicated to top artists, albums, and tracks that you can filter over select time periods. There's brief informational overviews for all of these, too&mdash;but the app was lacking in what the website did best: comprehensive listening reports (we want a musical calling card, after all), music recommendations and discovery, and even some of its social aspects.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Music as a center</h3>
                    
            <p>Before working to redesign Last.fm, I had initially planned to create a concept for an all-around "recommendation" site. Like the scrobbling site, it would be built around chrome extensions and service integrations (Spotify, Goodreads, IMDB...)&mdash;I realized this would be trying to achieve too much.</p>
                    
            <div class="col">
                <div class="col-half">

                    
                    <span class="image-container">

            <div class="col-half">

                    
                    <span class="image-container">

                        <img class="image-full" src="../assets/portfolio/lastfm/lovedlive-sketch-2.png">

                    </span>
                
                </div>  
            </div>  
                      
            <p>Instead, I would borrow a lot of concepts from this redesign for the Last.fm mobile app.</p>
                    
        
        <h3>Feature Mapping</h3>
            
            <p>I talked to existing Last.fm users and explored Last.fm alternatives to explore issues with the current mobile experience.</p>
                    
            

        <ul class="feature-large">
            <li><strong>Missing key features ðŸ‘Ž </strong><br>
            Users often use the mobile site to substitute with the app: listening history, discovery, and social features aren't accessible on the mobile app</li>
            
            <li><strong>No mobile onboarding ðŸ‘Ž</strong><br>
            No onboarding or syncing on mobile, only on desktop&mdash;alienating mobile-first listeners</li>
            
            
            <li><strong>Missing integrations ðŸ‘Ž</strong><br>
            Scrobbling support is only built-in for Spotify mobile and local files</li>
            
            
            <li><strong>Minimal track information ðŸ‘Ž</strong><br>
            Unlike the web version that brings up biographies, lyrics, and other key information about music&mdash;our mobile version has sparse content.</li>
        </ul>
                    
        
            <p>It was clear that there was a suite of product features inaccessible in the application. What stood out to me was the <strong>lack of listening history</strong>, which presumably should be accessible since the current mobile app mainly gives users information on their <em>previous scrobbles</em>.</p>
             
                
        <center>
        <div class="p-emphasis">How can we give on-the-go listeners the ability to understand and discover their music?</div>
        </center>

                
            <p>What does Last.fm serve when it tracks music you're playing on your phone, without letting you dive into that history? Tracking and listening history would become a priority.<br> As we go mobile and listen to music on-the-go: users should be able to see their listening history and its breakdowns, and then be able to participate in discussions from them. </p>
                    
                    
 <h3>New Architecture & Map</h3>
                    
                    <p>For this iteration of the redesign, I prioritized building an onboarding flow, showcasing listening history and statistics, reworking the way music information is presented, and introducing the social aspects of the site on mobile through profiles. </p>
                    
                    <span class="image-container">

                    <p>I sketched a base flow for the redesign taking into account these features. The original mobile app only had a view for the top tracks, and then recent scrobbles. Much of my flow was based on ensuring web spaces were found on the app.</p><br>

    <h3>Prioritizations</h3>
        <ul class="feature-large">
            <li><strong>Universality ðŸŒŽ</strong><br>
            While eyeing to add a breadth of web features on Last.fm, I kept in mind how <em>sizable amounts of users are non-English speaking</em>. (Many of the most popular Last.fm integrations and extensions are made by users outside of the English-speaking world!)<br>Keeping with minimalism and intuitive visual flows was key; I didn't want to detract from the way deeper navigation happens on the web.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Immediacy ðŸ—‚</strong><br>Last.fm has fun social features and discovery, but I wanted to keep to the statistics and history that many users were prioritizing and looking for in the app. I opted to leave out some web features like neighbors and events to focus on the peg as a <em>musical calling card.</em></li>
            
            
        </ul>
