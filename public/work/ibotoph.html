                    <h1>Advocating for progressives in the Philippine midterms</h1>
                    <p>May 13, 2019 would mark the midterm of President Rodrigo Duterte&mdash;with it, key senatorial, party list, and local positions to be contested. Progressive candidates with limited funds for on-the-ground campaigning were easily lagging behind in polls and surveys.</p>


                    <h3>Problem Identification</h3>
                    
                    <ul class="feature-large">
                        <li> <strong>Low public awareness ðŸ‘Ž</strong><br>Masses don't hear or see any info about these candidates&mdash;they're not aware of them at all.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Poor or nonexistent candidate information online ðŸ‘Ž</strong> <br>Online, candidates don't create primary sources for themselves; progressive candidates aren't talked about on the media.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Disjoint resources and rampant disinformation ðŸ‘Ž</strong> <br>The "fake news" issue in these countries isn't only an issue of ignorance, it's an issue of intentional disruption, dissonance, and manipulation. There are frequently limited spaces of truth for candidate info, especially lesser-popular ones not covered by the media.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>From <a href="https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/220707-senatorial-candidates-survey-performance-2019-elections" target="_blank">senatorial candidate surveys</a>, it was clear that awareness and education were paralyzing issues. At the same time, majority of Filipinos reported the internet and social media as their tool for information in the electoral season. It was clear: <mark>the web space was an underexplored platform that we wanted to investigate.</mark></p>
                

                    <p>In the months preceding the election, I began brainstorming with Developh organization mates on how we could propel voter education to the masses. Intentionally targeting social media and more visual-oriented, compact means of information dissemination, I was thinking closely about the <em>76 million social media users (71% penetration)</em> in the Philippines, with 72 million of those being mobile social media users. Filipinos are communicating, learning, and congregating online.</p>

                    </center>

                    <p><strong>OUR QUESTIONS</strong>&mdash;How can we educate voters through social platforms? How can we encourage discussion and conversations for the Filipino voter?</p>


                    <p><strong>MY ROLE</strong>&mdash;I managed a team of 12, now 25 in its second iteration from engineers, writers, and designers; leading the design and engineering for an end-to-end voter education experience and our models for campaigning.</p>

                    <h3>Focusing on progressive candidates</h3>
                    <p> In its inception, the vision for Iboto.ph was to be a database for all candidates. We already knew that certain parties topped the popularity charts and that it was difficult for other senatorial candidates to put together resources to match these campaigns.</p>

                    <p>Instead of being an all-around platform, the team decided to publish pages for <mark>progressive candidates only</mark> to specifically forward and act as a unique network collating these candidates together. This decision would then pave the usage we would imagine for the tool, as well as how we would position and distribute ourselves.</p>

                    <h1>Elections for the online Filipino</h1>


                    <p>Meaning "to vote" in Tagalog, the title Iboto.ph was chosen for its simplicity and forwardness. <br><br>Mostly made in three weeks prior to the May 13 elections with a small team, we surveyed the Philippine digital landscape and began building a framework for our voter education platform after initial research and talks with political campaigners and online citizens.</p>


                    <div class="image-container-long">

                    <div class="persona" style="float:right;padding:1.3em;">
                        <img src="../assets/portfolio/iboto/persona-1.png">
                        <h4>Juan</h4>
                        <p>Class D/C; uses mobile data and Facebook lite daily to chat with friends/family, game, post pictures. Frequently comments and shares, uses Messenger and also text messaging a lot. On occasion, visits computer shop but for more work-related tasks. </p>

                    </div>

                    <p>To present information effectively, we opted for a website with infographic-like displays. On first glance, viewers would be able to see candidate stances on critical and timely issues &mdash; from lowering the minimum age of criminal responsibility to divorce. Each point would link the user to a relevant article or claim about the chosen information. </p>
                    
                    <p>Procuring viewpoints on each issue was a bit of a challenge: we wanted to standardize viewpoints on key issues as much as possible, but shifted the list of stances based on what users frequently searched. We also sifted through their social accounts, past interviews, official senatorial debates, and program lists (for the few that had materials) in order to come up with eight key stances for the landing. <br>To better this process, members of the team conducted card sorting tests with a selection of respondents to prioritize what stances to highlight after constructing the initial list.</p><br><br>


                    <h3>Key Questions</h3>
                    <p><em>What are my values? What change am I looking for in the Philippine senate? What qualifications am I looking for in a candidate? What am I looking for in a candidate? What information do I need to retain about my candidate? How can I further engage with my candidate?</em>
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <p>From these key questions, we made assumptions that we would then support with all our project's choices: <strong>that voters are looking to actively learn, and have changeable minds</strong>. Our marketing and language would then target demographics of <em>active, online users</em> who were still <em>undecided in their voting slate, or receptive to change</em> as our key audience&mdash;as opposed to wasting critical time on set-voters. <em>(A similar focus on "undecided" voters also happened in the Cambridge-Analytica scandal.)</em></p>


                    <h3>Users & Neutrality</h3>
                    <p>While continuing inquiry through our first pages, we kept these questions in mind. We then primarily designed for two demographics: <mark>Existing supporters to spread awareness, and undecided voters to educate</mark>.</p>

                    <p>Iboto.ph was being frequently used as a starting point for discussion, targeting the issue of weaving candidate connections beyond drawn party lines and offering multi-format, extensive backgrounds for our chosen candidates compiled from all the online sources we could find.<br>To reflect this, we had altered our personas and added an additional user: using our social platforms as one of their main information sources during the elections, with our information being their primary gateways to other news sources or candidates.</p>

                    <p> At this stage, we had begun sourcing feedback from volunteer campaign groups (mostly youth ones), friends and family, and other organic online reach who quickly pointed out accessibility issues, talked about policies to focus on, or specific points about each candidate we should highlight. <br> <br>We sourced through contextual inquiry and through volunteer users who had reached out to us. Most users were sharing the link with the generated candidate previews, then poking around the rest of the site. </p>

                    <h3>Designing for Free Data</h3>
                    <p>A piece of feedback helped us recognize we were neglecting a key demographic: users on free Facebook data. On "free" mode, users can browse, message, but are unable to access external links or view videos. We began releasing text-based "tl;drs" and infographics for candidates to encourage more sharing. <br>Another key piece of feedback was exposure to new candidates that users found most insightful. At this stage, most of our candidates had no large media presence. Users were delighted and found the most use out of discovering new candidates, then using our site as a gateway to explore more about them and others.</p>

                    <p><strong>Value sharing:</strong> After getting a better sense of actual use cases, we understood that from now on&mdash;the point of expansion was to <mark>convert, and engage people with candidates who hold aligned values.</mark> <em>We constrained our selection</em> from our initial goal of displaying voter information for all, making an intentional choice to serve more overlooked candidates with shared values.</p>

                    <p>From here, we focused on extending the platform: creating downloadable posters, PDFs, text-based information sheets, and more from the candidate base we had created. The template we had served 7 candidates, displaying salient issues to their background to educational experiences. Iteration here was a lot of refining content and methods of display, most especially when direct campaign leads for these candidates reached out to us.</p><br>

                    <h3>Candidate Targeting</h3>
                    <p>Our progressive platform focused on campaigning for seven nominees. We rotated content and marketing for campaigns, sending out surveys and gathering user opinions to generate content. </p><br>

                    <p><strong>Challenges</strong>&nbsp; The language, presentation, and marketing we would deploy across our social platforms would dictate the initial user attitude to the website. We wanted the candidate pages to be as neutral as possible, serving to inform&mdash;this design decision made us put more weight into marketing and methods of dissemination, as well as focusing more on research and information. This was supported by the analytics we had on our organic growth.</p>


                    <h3>Candidate Screens</h3>

                    <p>We iterated through various layouts and information displays after working on some simple card sorting and usability tests. The above showcases the design we landed on; focused on a notable usage of external links, the deprioritization of education in the page hierarchy, and custom summaries.</p>

                    <blockquote>For our marketing materials, we kept in touch with campaign teams of as much candidates as we could (particularly Leody de Guzman, Samira Gutoc, Pilo Hilbay, and Neri Colmenares) to help disseminate information and provide additional context + historical information. To keep up to date, I was managing a team of over 8 active volunteers from around the world, around-the-clock to release publicity materials. We had come up with design templates and a system, as well as a protocol for article writing and announcements. Our Twitter was reaching 10,000+ engagements per tweet, and our Facebook with 6,000+ engagements and 50,000+ views on the regular. </blockquote>

                        What's the next step after engagement? Many users inquired on our pages on steps to support candidates. Our eyes are next set on direct action.

                        <li><strong>Localization for accessibility and language</strong><br>
                        We're deployed in a country that speaks over 150 languages. English may be an official language, but we're looking to offer localized versions of the product. For now, we focus on key points, concise language, and visual indicators.

                        <li><strong>Nudging users to act</strong><br>
                        We're looking more intensively on how to bridge the gap between awareness and action.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Combatting disinformation</strong><br>
                        A successful space we explored was on-the-spot reporting and journalism: from vote counts to illegal campaigning and fallacious statements. People are always online, and we know they need to be in the know. We're exploring how an update stream can increase engagement while offering another realm of political education.

                    <h1>Conversation as progress</h1>
                    
                    <p><mark>Iboto.ph</mark> evolved beyond our initial goal: we wanted to initially build a website that displayed information about each and every candidate. We made a very early decision to focus on progressive candidates that then set a new opportunity area: conversation and communication&mdash;one that wouldn't have risen in its original form.</p>
                    
                    <p>The next Philippine elections are happening in 2022. The team behind Iboto.ph is thinking of how to further transform the digital space for education, awareness, and discussion as we did with Iboto.ph&mdash;with these 2022 elections, we have a lot to tackle. Thankfully, Iboto.ph's pilot taught us about establishing user loyalty&mdash;and how things will never end up as you expect.</p>

                        <li>Design to satisfy user desires: we furthered Iboto.ph's social presence as users moved to use our tools to carry conversations over.</li>

                        <li>Neutrality is not an option: designing to reach those who could change their viewpoints and spread the word to support our candidates was priority&mdash;tech is never neutral.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>There's value in engaging with the principles that voters believe in, and using those as grounds to understand, listen, and respond effectively. <em>Fighting categorization and labeling</em> through engagement was key, and we're looking forward to more spaces that encourage discussions like this.</p>
