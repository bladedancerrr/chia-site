                    <h1>Advocating for progressives in the Philippine midterms</h1>
                    <p>May 13, 2019 would mark the midterm of President Rodrigo Duterte&mdash;with it, key senatorial, party list, and local positions to be contested. Progressive candidates with limited funds for on-the-ground campaigning were easily lagging behind in polls and surveys.</p>

                    <p>In the months preceding the election, I began brainstorming with Developh organization mates on <mark>how we could propel voter education to the masses.</mark> 
                    Intentionally targeting social media and more visual-oriented, compact means of information dissemination, I was thinking closely about the <em>76 million social media users (71% penetration)</em> in the Philippines, with 72 million of those being mobile social media users. Filipinos are communicating, learning, and congregating online.</p>
                    
                    <p>From <a href="https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/220707-senatorial-candidates-survey-performance-2019-elections" target="_blank">senatorial candidate surveys</a>, it was clear that awareness and education were paralyzing issues. At the same time, majority of Filipinos reported the internet and social media as their tool for information in the electoral season. It was clear: <mark>the web space was an underexplored platform that we wanted to investigate.</mark></p>

                    <p><strong>OUR PRODUCT</strong>&mdash;a web-focused means for Filipino voters to be informed of progressive candidates, driving political discourse surrounding them.

                       <em>Initially, we started out with a website. Iboto.ph then heavily used social media to  disseminate information and engage with voters, with our website as a primary tool.</em> 
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>OUR QUESTIONS</strong>&mdash;How can we educate voters through social platforms? How can we encourage discussion and conversations for the Filipino voter?</p>


                    <p><strong>MY ROLE</strong>&mdash;I managed a team of 12, now ~25 in its second iteration from engineers, writers, and designers; leading the design and engineering for an end-to-end voter education experience and our models for campaigning.</p>

        <details>
            <summary>
            <p> In its inception, the vision for Iboto.ph was to be a database for all candidates. We already knew that certain parties topped the popularity charts and that it was difficult for other senatorial candidates to put together resources to match these campaigns.</p></summary>
             <p>Instead of being an all-around platform, the team decided to publish pages solely for <mark>progressive candidates</mark> to specifically forward and act as a unique network collating these candidates together. They frequently have smaller campaign teams and budgets compared to other candidates. We wanted to drive our efforts into upholding them as opposed to having mixed content. Supporters and dissenters alike could use our page to inform them directly of these candidates and the work we believe they're doing well and right.<br>This decision would then pave the usage we would imagine for the tool, as well as how we would position and distribute ourselves.</p>

                    <h1>Elections for the online Filipino</h1>


                    <p>Meaning "to vote" in Tagalog, the title Iboto.ph was chosen for its simplicity and forwardness. <br>

                    <h3>Key Question ↗  Undecided voters are key</h3>
                    <p><em>What are my values? What change am I looking for in the Philippine senate? What qualifications am I looking for in a candidate? What am I looking for in a candidate? What information do I need to retain about my candidate? How can I further engage with my candidate?</em>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Our key assumption: <mark> voters are looking to actively learn, and have changeable minds</mark>. Our marketing and language would then target demographics of <em>active, online users</em> who were still <em>undecided in their voting slate, or receptive to change</em> as our key audience.</p>


        

        <p>Next, our goal was to put ourselves in the place of the Filipino voter. To do this, I constructed a journey map so we could clarify intentions and desires for our proto-personas and help define key actions and features with our team, guiding feature development.</p>
                    
      <span class="image-container">

            </span>
                    
    <p>Understanding these actions and the nuances in user needs and considerations helped us move forward.</p>

                    
        <h3>Positioning Iboto.ph</h3>
            <span class="image-container">

            </span>
                    
        <p><strong> National Brand</strong>&mdash;we needed a strong, consistent identity that made it clear we were here to politically engage. Our palette uses accent colors (and a main red) borrowed from the Philippine flag. These components and mateiral were reused throughout the project.</p>
                    
        <p><strong>Ethical Design</strong>&mdash;while considering design for a majority market, <a href="https://2017.ind.ie/ethical-design/" target="_blank">ethical design principles</a> were core to our work. Focusing on human rights: <em>reducing inequality to access to information,</em> then easing human effort: <em>respecting functional, convenient, and reliable designs,</em> and then creating for a <em>delightful</em> human experience were key to our process. </p>

                    <p><strong>Value sharing</strong>&mdash;After getting a better sense of actual use cases, we understood that from now on&mdash;the point of expansion was to <mark>convert, and engage people with candidates who hold aligned values.</mark> <em>Recall, we constrained our selection</em> from our initial goal of displaying voter information for all, making an intentional choice to serve more overlooked candidates with shared values.</p>

    <div class="col">
    <div class="col-half">
    <p>
    <strong>Engage through social media, but educate deeper.</strong> Discovery and discourse was clearly funneled in through social media, but people sourced for truth elsewhere. Knowing what platforms to use as <em>funnels</em> and where to <em>deliver the bulk of our content</em> became key choices and considerations.</p>
        
    <p>
    <strong>Empowerment is key.</strong> Every voter wants to feel like they're doing the right thing for the country. Every voter, despite their initial choices, deserves to be given the best suite of tools to help them decide&mdash;and even influence. <mark>Our philosophy was to resource knowledge to underrepresented candidates to spark discussion.</mark></p>    
        
    </div>
    <div class="col-half">
        
        
    
    <p><strong>People are ready to engage.</strong> Hundreds of respondents and dozens of interviewees mentioned desire to actively engage: be it sharing a piece of content or sparking discussion. This helped us know that we could <em>prompt our users</em> and they would <em>generate their own discussions</em>&mdash;we were facilitators not only in education, but in dissemination too. </p>
        
        
        <p><strong>To raise awareness, raise stances.</strong> This was a non-negotiable we found to many voters.</p>

    <h3>Designing candidate screens</h3>
        <p>We iterated through various layouts and information displays through <mark>card sorting and usability tests</mark>. From research, we focused on empowering users with information, and highlighting key leanings, deprioritizing meritocratic spaces like education.</p>

        <p><strong>Candidate Page</strong>&mdash;Collating candidate stances was a challenge: we wanted to standardize viewpoints on key issues as much as possible, but shifted stance organization based on key issues. <em>In the future, reordering this based on more solid data would be ideal.</em> </p>

            <p><strong>Selecting Candidates</strong>&mdash;With a tight timeline, we published guides for a total of seven candidates. We chose these candidates in order of our political alignment with them, and the level of coordination we could have with their campaign teams. Other candidates that we didn't have direct networks to were sourced later due to the amount of research it took our copywriters.</p>

        <p>From here, we focused on extending the platform: creating downloadable posters, PDFs, text-based information sheets, and more from the candidate base we had created. The template we had served 7 candidates, displaying salient issues to their background to educational experiences. Iteration here was a lot of refining content and methods of display, most especially when direct campaign leads for these candidates reached out to us.</p><br>
                    
    <p>At peak, I was managing a team of over 12 active volunteers from 3 timezones (me mostly 12 hours behind) to build engagement and continue releases and iterations of our product.</p>

                    <h1>Transforming the digital space in political contexts</h1>

                    <p>Through Iboto.ph, we were astounded not only by the traction and numbers we hit, but by the engagement of the platform. <mark>The internet is a tool not maximally used by Philippine candidates:</mark> this project we came up with in only three weeks, sometimes doing the barebones work of comprehensively talking about a candidate's platforms, set us up to realize how much more work could be done in the space.</p>

                    
                    <ul class="feature-large">
                        <li><strong>Building engagement</strong><br>
                        What's the next step after engagement? Many users inquired on our pages on steps to support candidates. Our eyes are next set on direct action.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Localization for accessibility and language</strong><br>
                        We're deployed in a country that speaks over 150 languages. English may be an official language, but we're looking to offer localized versions of the product. For now, we focus on key points, concise language, and visual indicators.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Nudging users to act</strong><br>
                        We're looking more intensively on how to bridge the gap between awareness and action.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Combatting disinformation</strong><br>
                        A successful space we explored was on-the-spot reporting and journalism: from vote counts to illegal campaigning and fallacious statements. People are always online, and we know they need to be in the know. We're exploring how an update stream can increase engagement while offering another realm of political education.

                    <p>Iboto.ph evolved as a product far beyond our initial product: we wanted to initially build a website that displayed information about each and every candidate. We made an  early decision to focus on progressive candidates that then set a new opportunity area: conversation and communication&mdash;one that wouldn't have risen in its original form.</p>
                    
                    <p>The next Philippine elections are happening in 2022. The team behind Iboto.ph is thinking of how to further transform the digital space for education, awareness, and discussion as we did with Iboto.ph.</p>

            
                    
                    <ul class="feature-large">

                        <li><strong>Design for desires, especially the untapped ones</strong>&mdash;we furthered Iboto.ph's social presence as users moved to use our tools to carry conversations over, and empowered users with our suite of tools.</li>

                        <li><strong>Neutrality is not an option</strong>&mdash;designing to reach those who could change their viewpoints and spread the word to support our candidates was priority&mdash;tech is never neutral.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>There's value in engaging with the principles that voters believe in, and using those as grounds to understand, listen, and respond effectively. <em>Fighting categorization and labeling</em> through engagement was key, and we're looking forward to more spaces that encourage discussions like this.</p>
