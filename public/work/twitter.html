However, with the growth in Twitter's users and new algorithms that tend to result in more "viral" content, it's easier for people to feel lost in the conversation. Our objective was to make <strong>notifications and engagements more intuitive at scale</strong>, to convert and measure more follower relationships and sustained interaction between users.</p>


                        <div class="summary-details">
                            <span class="summary-add"><strong>Roles</strong> Team Lead, UX Research & Design</span>

                    <h2 id="part-context">Context</h2>
                    <h1>Elevating the Twitter conversation</h1>
                    <p><mark>Notifications</mark> are key to the Twitter platform: it's how engagement spreads. Recent Twitter developments trend through this, such as with algorithmic feeds that recommend tweets from the interactions of our followed user's own followings.</p>

                    <p>After being tasked to identify an area of improvement from the user profile page, we thought intentionally about core interactions becoming a spectacle. In contrast to desired goals of larger reach, inhibiting large conversations closes people on to follower loops. <mark>We believe there's space for notifications as they are today to grow to a place for stronger connections, and not just meaningless numbers. </mark></p>


                    <p>Due to the timeframe (less than three days!) and with the given scope, we relied on quick user interviews, conversations with current engineers, and friends-and-family input to gather frustrations. We penned these down on boards and saw a common theme around interactions:</p>


                    <h3>Problem Identification</h3>

                    <span class="image-container" style="padding:2em; float: right;">
                        <center> <img style="max-width:250px" src="../assets/portfolio/twitter/flow-tweetpermalink.png">
                            <sub></sub></center>
                    </span>

                    <p>There are three problem areas we wanted to tackle:</p>
                    <ol class="feature-large">
                        <li>Unable to easily access the list of users who have engaged with a tweet<br><em>Lack of a search feature, requiring users to visit a profile and look through the "likes" or "tweets" tab to confirm an interaction has occurred.</em></li>

                        <li>No categorization or clear algorithm of display for like/retweet engagements</li>

                        <li>Viewing a tweet's quoted tweets is only possible when pasting in a tweet's permalink in the search</li>

                    </ol>

                    <p>Interestingly, many users sharing their frustrations gave <strong>comparisons</strong>&mdash;they weren't looking for new groundbreaking features or algorithmic changes, they wanted quality of life fixes—referencing functionalities present in other apps. These smaller gestures and usability pieces stuck out to us as our focus.</p>

    <div class="persona">
    <center></center>
    <h5>PERSONA: VERY ONLINE TWEETER</h5>
    <h4>Cane</h4>
    <p>Checks on Twitter multiple times a day (more when procrastinating) as a nineteen-year-old university student up-to-date on pop culture. Twitter is not just for news, more like tidbits, first joke source. and group DMs. Interacts mostly with friends with a &lt;700 followers, most are mutuals. Follows celebrities, pop culture, and comedy accounts on Twitter. Engages liberally through likes and retweets and isn't afraid to tweet their mind or have conversations run long in threads.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Needs to accomplish</strong>&mdash;find more people to engage with on Twitter, join more conversations</li>        
   
            <li><strong>Needs to feel</strong>&mdash;open and informed: that they have access to te information they about the users they engage with</li>  
            <li><strong>Considerations</strong>&mdash;How can key information about interactions be made visible to Cane? What spaces can be utilized to find more users to engage with?</li>  
        </ul>
        
    </div>
<div class="persona">
    <center></center>
    <h5>PERSONA: FOR THE NEWS, CASUAL USER</h5>
    <h4>Mary</h4>
    <p>Checks Twitter a few times a week, especially when prompted by the news (e.g. following breaking events, hearing their President tweeted something) as a middle-aged, responsible user. Not enough time to be online without intent. Not concerned with profile completion, but excited at conversation and discoverability. Likes tweets liberally, low follower count (&lt;100). Mostly engages through replies and "lurks" on the application.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Needs to accomplish</strong>&mdash;receive information and updates as it happens around news and specific topics of interest</li>        
   
            <li><strong>Needs to feel</strong>&mdash;focused: that what they need is right there, without any clutter; able to voice out: that their opinion and discussion is valid and shared</li>  
            <li><strong>Considerations</strong>&mdash;How can Mary navigate their news and update feeds and the people who interact with them at ease?</li>  
        </ul>
        
    </div>

                    <br>

                    <span class="image-container" style="padding:1em;">
                        <img class="image-full" src="../assets/portfolio/twitter/goal-2.png">
                    </span>

                    <p>From this series of observations and with our personas in mind, we defined goals based on Twitter's recent product releases and opportunity areas in our problem scope:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Use tweet engagements as a space to drive more connections through an <em>entrypoint for follow-follower relationships, and continued conversations through quote tweets.</em></li>
                        <li>Increase user engagement with people outside of their mutual space (people who follow them, others) <mark>increasing follow-up interactions</mark>; and</li>
                        <li>Increase user follow-follower relationship entry points through the engagement space</li>

                    </ol>


                    <p>We want Cane to not feel overwhelmed when he goes viral, or be able to join in the conversation even after a few hours. Mary wants to sort through replies faster because they have little time, and feel like their inputs are being seen when responding to larger figureheads&mdash;they may also benefit from more followers and interaction.</p>

                    <center>
                        <div class="p-emphasis" style="font-family:'GT America' !important"> Our goal is to reframe Twitter's engagements as a space to form connections&mdash;at any size, to convert likes, retweets, and replies, into places for follow relationships and continued conversation </div>
                    </center>

                    <p><strong>Repurposing existing components</strong> was also a key design decision. There are QoL fixes and shouldn't take too much sprints to put out; we wanted something measurable that wouldn't take too much engineering time away from larger features: so to keep the design true and build on many underexplored portions of Twitter's functionality, everything is reused.</p>

                    <p>Better engagements introduces an array of quality of life fixes in the <mark>tweet and timeline engagements area</mark>, here's a brief overview of the spaces that we're touching:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Search Engagements</strong>: This allows users to search under the “liked by” and “retweeted by” menu’s to see which accounts engaged with that tweet</li>

                        <li><strong>Quote Tweet Presence</strong>: Allows users to see the who quoted tweets and what they said. Enables continued conversation whether it be about comedy or politics</li>

                        <li><strong>Categorized engagements</strong>: Along with searching through the accounts who've liked or shared a tweet, we're ordering them in collapsible categories based on your follow relationship – enabling you to discover new people or see your interactions with your mutuals</li>

                        <u>Categorized views</u> let users filter through mutuals (people you follow & people who follow you back), people you follow, and others. When looking at engagements with viral tweets, it's easier to see how your network has connected with it.<br>
                        <u>A search bar</u> allows users to specifically filter through @s and account names to look at whether a user has interacted with material previously. When this information is public on profiles, it makes sense to have this easily viewable on Twitter's other spaces, too.</p>

                        <p>The best way to captivate audiences is to engage directly with them. With these new engagement views, we saw an opportunity to allow brands to appear at the top of the appropriate caegory as "promoted" given they've genuinely interated with the user's Tweet.<br>
                        Allowing promoted accounts in search encourages brand interaction and exciting new lead generation opportunities beyond the feed: this is a step forward to let brands tell users they're here, and they want to listen.

It's easy to see how repetitive (yet, still funny) jokes made through quote retweets can get at times.</p>

            <p>Lists on Twitter are one of the most important spaces for users to connect with one another. They allow users to curate interests, build feeds to share with others, and express connection. Lists are available in the tabs at the left&mdash;but we saw underutilized space on the user profile to directly show Twitter users of their presence on this community platform.</p>

                    <h1>Neutrality or visibility?</h1>

                    <p>This case study brought to our attention a lot of facets of Twitter interaction: what algorithmic choices at one endpoint can do in influencing user desires and actions, the necessity of putting up safety measures when increasing visibility, and also valuing certain metrics over others&mdash;in our case, follow relationships. </p>

                    <p>Navigating engagement and performance is tricky. But what makes Twitter incredible is all these untapped features: DMs turning global conversation into intimate connections, to recognizing the jokes and also controversies from quote tweets. Taking the timeline to another level was interesting when recognizing that conversation is more than just in its 280-character purity: simple clarifications on the interface and understanding of user behaviors has the potential to create huge ripples in engagement.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The value of giving users <strong>authentic experiences and giving them agency</strong> in their interactions can increase engagement rather than inhibit it.</li>
                        <li>We're moving away from the tweet as the sole conversation piece and letting users build on them&mdash;just as talk goes in real life.</li>
                        <li>Massive overhauls or new features aren't the only way to drive growth or conversions. Listening to user interactions and looking into subtle competitor interactions rather than just large new features is hugely informational.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>Better Engagements is also a take on control over communities. The tweets we engage with are very telling&mdash;it's a common joke for a reason that "to know someone truly you should look through their Twitter likes." </p>
