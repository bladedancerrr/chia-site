However, with the growth in Twitter's users and new algorithms that tend to result in more "viral" content, it's easier for people to feel lost in the conversation. Our objective was to make <strong>notifications and engagements more intuitive at scale</strong>, to convert and measure more follower relationships and sustained interaction between users.</p>

                    <h1>Elevating the Twitter conversation</h1>
                    <p><mark>Notifications</mark> are key to the Twitter platform: it's how engagement spreads. Recent Twitter developments trend through this, such as with algorithmic feeds that recommend tweets from the interactions of our followed user's own followings.</p>
                    
                    <p>After being tasked to identify an area of improvement from the user profile page, we thought intentionally about core interactions becoming a spectacle. In contrast to desired goals of larger reach, inhibiting large conversations closes people on to follower loops. <mark>We believe there's space for notifications as they are today to grow to a place for stronger connections, and not just meaningless numbers. </mark></p>
                    
                    
                    <p>Due to the timeframe (less than three days!) and with the given scope, we relied on quick user interviews, conversations with current engineers, and friends-and-family input to gather frustrations. We penned these down on boards and saw a common theme around interactions:</p>

                    <h3>Problem Identification</h3>
                    
                    <span class="image-container" style="padding:1em; float: right;">

                    </span>
                    
                    <p>There are three problem areas we wanted to tackle with "viral", mass-shared tweets:</p>
                    
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Unable to easily access the list of users who have engaged with a tweet<br><em>Lack of a search feature, requiring users to visit a profile and look through the "likes" or "tweets" tab to confirm an interaction has occurred.</em></li>
                        
                        <li>No categorization or clear algorithm of display for like/retweet engagements</li>
                        
                        <li>Viewing a tweet's quoted tweets is only possible when pasting in a tweet's permalink in the search</li>
                    
                    </ol> 
                    
                    <p>Interestingly, many users sharing their frustrations gave <strong>comparisons</strong>&mdash;they weren't looking for new groundbreaking features or algorithmic changes, they wanted QoL functionalities present in other apps. These smaller gestures and usability pieces stuck out to us as our focus.</p>
                    
                    <div class="persona">
                        <h5>PERSONA: CASUAL VERY ONLINE TWEETER</h5>
                        <h4>Cane</h4>
                        <p>Checks on Twitter multiple times a day (more when procrastinating) as a nineteen-year-old university student up-to-date on pop culture. Twitter is not just for news, more like tidbits, first joke source. and group DMs. Interacts mostly with friends with a &lt;700 followers, most are mutuals. Follows celebrities, pop culture, andd comedy accounts on Twitter. Engages liberally through likes and retweets and isn't afraid to tweet their mind or have conversations run long in threads.</p>

                        <h5>PERSONA: FOR THE NEWS</h5>
                        <h4>Mary</h4>
                        <p>Checks Twitter a few times a week, especially when prompted by the news (e.g. following breaking events, hearing their President tweeted something) as a middle-aged, responsible user. Not enough time to be online without intent. Not concerned with the aesthetic side of the Twitter (Mary hasn't updated their photo since 2015 and has never uploaded a header), but excited at conversation and discoverability. Likes tweets liberally, low follower count (&lt;100). Mostly engages through replies and "lurks" on te application.</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <br>

                    <p>From this series of observations and with our personas in mind, we defined goals based on Twitter's recent prodduct releases and opportunity areas in our problem scope:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Use tweet engagements as a space to drive more connections through an <em>entrypoint for follow-follower relationships, and continued conversations through quote tweets.</em></li>
                        <li>Increase user engagement with people outside of their mutual space (people who follow them, others) <mark>increasing follow-up interactions</mark>; and</li>
                        <li>Increase user follow-follower relationship entrypoints through the engagement space</li>
                    
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>We want Cane to not feel overwhelmed when he goes viral, or be able to join in the conversation even after a few hours. Mary wants to sort through replies faster because they have little time, and feel like their inputs are being seen when responding to larger figureheads&mdash;they may also benefit from more followers and interaction.</p>

            <h1>Collab Website</h1>
            <p>I took on the task of engineering and designing the website for Collab. Our main goals with the website were to collate information about the event, especially on the incubator itself, in one area. Our registration funnels were mainly on other channels&mdash;so I focused on designing a visually pleasing, informational site.</p>
